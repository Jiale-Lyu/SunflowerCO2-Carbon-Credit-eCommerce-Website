        At Sunflower.com, we're dedicated to making it easy for you to
        contribute to a greener planet. We've partnered with Verra, a leading
        global carbon credit certification organization, to purchase a 1,000-ton
        carbon credit contract.

      <h3>Our Carbon Offset Card</h3>
      <p>
        Our Carbon Offset Card To simplify your involvement, we've transformed
        this large contract into 1,000 individual Carbon Offset Cards. Each card
        represents one ton of carbon credits from our Verra-backed contract. By
        purchasing a Carbon Offset Card, you are directly supporting the
        reduction of one ton of carbon emissions.

              <h4>Accessibility</h4>
              <p>
                Traditionally, carbon credits are sold in large quantities,
                making it difficult for individuals to contribute. Our cards
                break down this barrier, allowing you to participate in carbon
                offsetting in a manageable way.

              <h4>Permanent Commitment</h4>
              <p>
                Once we've purchased the carbon credit contract, we do not sell
                it again. This means that your investment in a Carbon Offset
                Card is secure and dedicated solely to offsetting carbon
                emissions.
